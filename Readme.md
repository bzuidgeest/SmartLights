Hello,

This is my conversion of the arduino code for the lyte smartlight (http://authometion.com).

It has the following primary features.

* Fully Untested
* Fully Undocumented
* Almost completely unfinished.

I have posted this for anyone that wants to, to look at. 

I consider everything in this solution to be under GPL v3. Text of which is included in license.txt
